# Breakdown of my past projects portfolio, tech skills, and approach.
The goal of this webpage is to provide a comprehensive overview of my skills, project examples, and showcase some of my data visualization skills. 

## My approach and experience
In short, I am using data to extract useful knowledge and insights to support stakeholders with key information that helps them make informed decisions. Since every project came with its assumptions, requirements, and limitations, I’ve learned how to be creative when solving problems with data. 

There is a universal problem that almost every company has to face: the data is either hard to get from the technical standpoint or it does not even exist in the first place.
Thanks to my expertise in psychological research, I was often able to expand the scope of the product-based metrics with additional research. Employing experiments (e.g. AB tests), custom surveys, and in-depth interviews played a crucial role in exploring user insights and needs.

## Technical skills
I believe that tech skills are less important than the ability to uncover stakeholder needs and define the exact questions that need to be answered. However, in the span of my career, my work required me to use a variety of tools to extract and clean the data before the analysis. 

SQL and Python are the backbone of the tech stack that I use. With that combination, there are almost no limits related to accessing, querying, cleaning, and working with data. The additional experience with AB testing, tracking tools, product analytics, CRMs, and BI tools, I am comfortable working with a variety of data in many different ways.

Depending on the project, I’ve utilized many different analysis techniques. Example use cases include:
- Regression-based models for investigating the impact of one metric on another, e.g. exploring the impact of using certain product features and buying another subscription.
- Survival analysis for analyzing user churn and key churn drivers.
- Various mean-based group comparison methods, e.g. for comparing the average ROI between active and inactive online community members.
- Cluster analysis and classification algorithms, very helpful for data-driven client segmentation.
- Time-series data analysis, including ARIMA and other prediction models.
